### Why oneloc.nvim?
Some time ago I stumbled upon [harpoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnos8aApa9g).
The idea is that you keep a persistent mapping between a small number of keys <-> locations.
But it was a bit too complex for my tastes. So I made my simplified version. Hope you'll like it.

## üì¶ Installation

Requires `neovim >= 0.8`

Using [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
```lua
{ 'lfrati/oneloc.nvim', config = function()
    -- values shown in setup are the defaults,
    -- feel free to call just require("oneloc").setup {} if you like them
    require("oneloc").setup {
        flash_t = 200,
        flash_color = "OnelocFlash",
        file_color = "ErrorMsg",
        short_path = false
    }
    for i=1,5 do
        vim.keymap.set({ "n" }, "<Leader>"..i, ":lua require('oneloc').goto("..i..")<CR>")
    end
    vim.keymap.set({ "n" }, "<Leader><Leader>o", ":lua require('oneloc').show()<CR>")

end }
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è  How it works

Super simple, there are only 2 functions you care aboout `show()` and `goto(n)` (see example mappings above)

`show()` creates a simple floating window that shows you the current locations

From there you have a few options:
- `ESC` close the floating window.
- `[1-5]` insert the current path in position `[1-5]`. If there was something there already, swap them.
- `d[1-5]` delete location in position `[1-5]`.
- `D` prompt the user `y/N` to delete ALL the locations.

That's it. The only other piece is `goto(n)`, can you guess what it does?
Yep. It opens the corresponding entry. (so `goto(2)` sends you to the second location in the floating windows, if it exists of course).

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
Upon landing somewhere a flash helps find where the cursor is.
- Don't like it? Set `flash_t = 0` in setup.
- Don't like the color? Set `flash_color = <HIGHLIGHT>` in setup, where `<HIGHLIGHT>` is the name of an existing highlight group (up to you to make sure it exists!).

Locations in the floating window, show the full path.
- Lines are too long? Set `short_path = true` to show only the first letters of folders
Filenames in the floating window are highlighted to more easily see them at a glance
- Don't like the color? Set `file_color = <HIGHLIGHT>` in setup using your favorite hightlight group.
