### Why oneloc.nvim?
Some time ago I stumbled upon [harpoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnos8aApa9g).
The idea is that you keep a persistent mapping between a small number of keys <-> locations.
From my search plugin [onesearch](https://github.com/lfrati/onesearch.nvim) I've realized I really like simple [minor-modes](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Minor-Modes.html).
Here is my take on a navigation plugin with a simple floating window and persistent locations. Hope you'll like it üôÇ 

## üì¶ Installation

Requires `neovim >= 0.9`

Using [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
```lua
{ 'lfrati/oneloc.nvim', config = function()
    -- values shown in setup are the defaults,
    -- feel free to call just require("oneloc").setup {} if you like them
    require("oneloc").setup {
        flash_t = 200,
        flash_color = "OnelocFlash",
        file_color = "OnelocRed", --        highlight filenames          to be MORE VISIBLE
        outdated_color = "OnelocGray", --   highlight outdated line info to be LESS VISIBLE
        uptodate_color = "OnelocGreen", --  highlight uptodate line info to be MORE VISIBLE
        granularity = "pos", --             "pos" = record cursor (pos)ition information
        width = 100 --                      Width of the information window
    }
    for i=1,5 do
        -- <Leader>[1-5] to go somewhere
        vim.keymap.set({ "n" }, "<Leader>"..i, ":lua require('oneloc').goto("..i..")<CR>")
        -- <Leader><Leader>[1-5] to record someplace
        vim.keymap.set({ "n" }, "<Leader><Leader>"..i, ":lua require('oneloc').store("..i..")<CR>")
    end
    vim.keymap.set({ "n" }, "<Leader><Leader>o", ":lua require('oneloc').show()<CR>")

end }
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è  How it works

There are only 2 functions you care aboout `show()` and `goto(n)` (see example mappings above)

`show()` creates a simple floating window that shows you the current locations:

- Red color = filename to get it at a glance üëÄ
- Green color = that's what your are going to find if you jump there üëç
- Gray color = that's what was there when you recorded the location ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

From there you have a few options:
- `ESC` close the floating window.
- `[1-5]` jump to the corresponding location.
- `D` prompt the user `y/N` to delete ALL the locations.
- `d[1-5]` delete location in position `[1-5]`.
- `i[1-5]` insert current location in position `[1-5]`. If this is too slow feel free to bind `require('oneloc').store(n)` to whatever you like, see #Installation for an example.
- `g` toggle granularity between `pos` (jump back to line/column where the location was saved) and `file` just open the file (may jump to last position, depending on your setup, see configuration)

That's it. The only other piece is `goto(n)`, can you guess what it does?
Yep. It opens the corresponding entry. (so `goto(2)` sends you to the second location in the floating windows, if it exists of course).

Note that when you add a new location, the line/column information is stored too. This way you can easily use it to move within large files, if you want.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
Upon landing somewhere a flash helps find where the cursor is.
- Don't like it? Set `flash_t = 0` in setup.
- Don't like the colors? Set `xxx_color = <HIGHLIGHT>` in setup, where `<HIGHLIGHT>` is the name of an existing highlight group (up to you to make sure it exists!).

- Not enough space on screen? No worries, the location information shrinks as width shrinks
  
| normal | shorter| shortest |
|---|---|---|

Locations include line/column information, this lets you use this plugin as a replacement for marks too.
- Don't like it and would rather just use it to jump between files? Set the default with `granularity = "file"` in setup. This way you'll go back to files as if you used `:edit file`. If you want to restore the last location when re-opening a file check `:h restore-cursor` or [this issue](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/16339#issuecomment-1457394370)
